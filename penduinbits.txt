about PENDUINBITS
-----------------

Not that anyone would be fooled, but just to be clear, penduinbits is
me.  One guy who likes Free software, likes to make toys, and whose
single marketable skill is software programming.

I use the handle "penduin", because it's a cool slight mispronounciation
of "penguin", an oddball sort of animal to which I don't have any special
connection, other than my fondness for Linux and all its GNU
surroundings.  I use the name "penduinbits" in place of a company or
organization where such identifiers are expected, and it's pretty
accurate.  The stuff I create and/or show off and/or distribute and/or
sell is going to be made of bits, most likely.  I can scribble some
amusing pictures, but I'm no artist.  I can cobble together simple
music, but I'm no musician.  I make bits.  I arrange digital information
into bit patterns with which people can (I hope) have fun.

about Halloween Artist
----------------------

I always loved carving jack-o-lanterns for Halloween.  I also love WebOS,
and got a TouchPad during that tiny window before HP decided it hated
success and discontinued it.  I thought it would be fun to have an app to
draw a face on a pumpkin and have it simulate the scooping out, carving,
and lighting.  You know, the messy parts.  I could try out lots of ideas
before committing to a design, not to mention it would be a great excuse
to learn about HTML5 canvas.

I banged out the app quickly, and it's still available for download in the
HP App Catalog.  But times change, WebOS has fewer and fewer users, and I
have come to love FirefoxOS as well.  So, I've retooled the Enyo1 WebOS
application into a general-purpose web app.  Other features like saving
and undo may return someday, but for the initial release I just want it
to fit and work well on a FirefoxOS phone and any web browser.
